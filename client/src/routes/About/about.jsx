    <strong>At Ocean Cleanup Initiative</strong>, we believe that small actions create big waves of change. Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste end up in our oceans, threatening marine life, polluting our coastlines, and disrupting ecosystems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our mission is to bring people together to clean beaches, raise awareness, and build a community that cares about the environment.
